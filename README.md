Usage
The Content Generator app provides a user-friendly interface where you can enter text in the input field and click the arrow button to generate a response. The responses are generated using the GPT API, and the conversation history is displayed on the right side.

--> To start a new chat, click the "+ New Chat" button.
--> Click on a chat history item on the left side to view the conversation for that particular topic.
--> The responses from the API will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

Customization
If you want to customize the app or add additional features, you can modify the App.js file and related components. Additionally, you can apply custom CSS styles by editing the index.css file to match your desired design.

Important Note
Please note that the app uses a specific API key to communicate with the GPT API. The deployed version of the app on Netlify uses the provided API key. If you need to use a different API key or want to deploy your own version of the app, make sure to update the API key in the App.js file with the correct one for the GPT API service you are using.
